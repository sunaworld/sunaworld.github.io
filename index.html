      Hi there! My name is Suna. I'm a first-year Journalism + Design student at Eugene Lang College
      of Liberal Arts. It's located at The New School which is in Greenwhich Village, New York City.
      I've always had a love for Journalism, with dreams of becoming one some day, hopefully with a
      daily segment on national TV.

      I have a lot of hobbies, as I consider myself a jack of all trades (but perhaps maybe not a master
      of any). I spend my free time exploring downtown NYC, reading, writing, sketching, taking photos,
      hanging out with friends, spending quality time with my mom and sister, watching shows and films,
      attending Broadway shows (as of late), studying, designing stuff on canva, and doomscrolling (insert shame).
      Some hobbies I'd love to pick up include: learning to skateboard, learning to roller/inline skate
      (I have both just sadly touch neither), and learning an instrument - I played the drums and piano for a while
      and own a keyboard, as well as an e-guitar, both of which are collecting dust in the corner of my room (insert
      more shame).

      Since I've told you about some of my hobbies, I figured I'd tell you about some of my favorite things.
      I don't have a favorite movie because it quite literally changes each time I watch or re-watch one. However,
      an all time favorite is, Rise of the Guardians. It's been my favorite for years, and I've watched it a million
      times without ever getting tired of it. I also really enjoy the Fast & Furious franchise, as well as the
      Spider-man
      movies! The Tom Holland and Miles Morales versions are my absolute favorite (sorry Tobey and Andrew).
      My favorite shows are a little easier to name with Stranger Things being my top choice, and All American,
      Wednesday and Bridgerton following close suit. Another thing I really love is music. Some of my favorite genres
      are pop, rap and R&B, with some of my favorite artists being Justin Bieber, The Weeknd, Partynextdoor and Travis
      Scott!

      Moving on from my interests, professionally, I've accomplished some things I'm really proud of:
      I hosted a Youtube talk show for roughly 4 years (give or take), published 2 books (both available on Amazon),
      became a reporter on the New School Free Press and published 4 stories with them, written my first poem which was
      accepted
      to be published by Eugene Lang's student journal, Eleven 1/2, and designed my own website (publication and
      copyright pending). Additionally, I've completed 4 pre-college programs before I ever finished High School,
      setting me up on a path to complete my graduation requirements early on. I also speak 3 languages fluently
      (English, German and Turkish), and have my Seal of Billingual Literacy in Korean!

    </p>

    <p>Now on to some background: I was born in Ludwigsburg, Germany, which is a city in the southwest-German state of
      Baden-Wurttemberg,
      where I was raised. Fun fact: Stuttgart is Baden-Wurttemberg's capital city! I lived in Germany for 6 years
      until I moved to
      New York City in March of 2013 (almost 13 years ago...crazy right?). I've lived in many places in the city since
      then, starting out
      in The Bronx and spending under 6 months there, living in Staten Island for 6 years and then moving to Harlem,
      in 2019, where I've lived ever since. While I was born in Germany, ethnically I'm African and Middle Eastern
      (Turkish and Cameroonian
      to be exact).
      My mom was born in Germany to Turkish parents, while my dad was born and raised in Cameroon before moving to
      Germany in his 30s.

    </p>

    <p>With that said, I want to say that this website is a digital walkthrough of my life. Everything from my
      background and current life,
      to future dreams and ambitions, hobbies, interests, and everything in between will be shared here. Welcome to my
      world... Sunaworld!
