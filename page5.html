        <p>
            I began drawing at 12 years old, but didn't really
            love it until I was about 14. My mom had always been one of my biggest art influences.
            I both admired and envied how talented she was and always wondered why
            I couldn't draw anything more than a stick figure.
            It was from that moment forward that I decided I would
            try and better myself. Till this day, drawing or sketching
            is something that provides me with a major peace of mind.
            I'm no Picasso or anything, but I think that when it comes
            to art, that honestly doesn't mean anything, as art can be found
            in anything and anyone. It's everywhere.
            Below I figured I'd show off some of my favorite pieces from over
            the years:
