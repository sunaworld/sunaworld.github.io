        <p>
            I see my future, and it's bright! As I've previously
            said, I've always dreamed about being a journalist, but I thought
            it would be fun to share what I've always hoped my future apartment
            would look like. I always imagined it would look something like this,
            full of cozy lighting, books, comfortable chairs, and lots of color.
            A space where my friends, family, and I can enjoy together, and make lots
            of memories!
