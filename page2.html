        <p>Below are images and descriptions of some of my
            many media influences.</p>

            <h2>Movies</h2>
            <p>
                I consider the media world to be one of the most
                captivating ones. I think good movies can provoke
                thought and new ideas, while allowing you to escape
                your world an enter a new one.

            <h2>Shows</h2>
            <p>
                Similarly to movies, shows allow you to escape reality,
                but perhaps even more deeply than a movie would. Through
                shows, you're able to build bonds with characters as you
                follow their journey of development through many years. The
                idea of being able to grow up with certain shows (shoutout Stranger
                Things) is one of the most touching things to me.

            <h2>Books</h2>
            <p>
                They allow us to enter all kinds of worlds through the
                power of our imagination. Lately, I've rediscovered my
                long lost love of literature, and in the past 2 months, have
                bought and collected over 25 books to add to my collection.

            <p>
                The people who bring all our imaginations to life through
                their gifts of storytelling and expression. I deeply adore and
                admire all who are driven by their passion and craft.

            <h2>Musicians</h2>
            <p>
                I love music so deeply. I believe music is a completely
                different genre of creatvity and can both heal and
                stimulate the brain. Music is my version of free therapy,
                and according to my Apple Music Replay, which displayed
                over 40,000 minutes listened and 500+ artists, I love
                WAY more music than I could possibly fit here.

            <h2>Fashion Icons</h2>
            <p>
                My long standing love of fashion persists constantly.
                From Vogue magazine to the Met Gala to celebrity
                paparazzi candids, all of it makes me fall in love
                with fashion over and over again. This short compilation
                of some of my favorite icons doesn't even begin to grasp
                how lengthy my list truly is.
