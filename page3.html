      <h2>
        NSFP ARTICLE 1
      </h2>

      <img class="left" src="images/article1.jpg" />
      This is the first story that I got published at the paper.
      Techincally it's the second story that I wrote, but deadline
      complications caused some glitches. However, this piece was centered
      around data reporting for the school's rank drop and was incredibly fun to write!

      <h2>
        NSFP ARTICLE 2
      </h2>
      <img class="right" src="images/article2.jpg" />
      This is my first article, which was published as my second. This story meant a lot
      to me because it was the first time I got to try our professional journalism. My editor
      put a lot of faith in me to handle this as my first story, and really helped me get
      accustomed to news writing. I learned a lot during those few weeks and recieved so much
      praise and support, it was such a wholesome experience.

      <h2>
        NSFP ARTICLE 3
      </h2>
      <img class="left" src="images/article3.jpg" />
      This news story is my third and it was a really big one. It was about how we have
      professors living in student residence halls. This experience was another great one,
      as I was able to not only interview a professor that lives in the dorm and find out her experience,
      but I was invited to do the interview in her apartmenet. I was even asked to come back a second time to be
      accompanied by a photographer. It was all super cool!

      <h2>
        NSFP ARTICLE 4
      </h2>
      <img class="right" src="images/article4.jpg" />
      This is my most recently published article, surrounding international students and the difficulties they faced/are
      facing
      within transitioning to a school in a new city and navigating through the help of ISSS. I am incredibly proud of
      this article for two reasons. 1. I got to
      interview
      so many amazing people, and I am so proud of the way I conducted them given that the topic was pretty
      sensetive. 2. This article is on the front page of the NSFP Fall 2025 Issue! (I mean talk about major
      accomplishments!)

      <h2>
        REFLECTION
      </h2>
      I'm incredibly greatful to have joined the paper as early as I did. I mean my first semester, of my first year of
      college, is such
      a crazy amazing time to join. I have wanted to be a journalist since forever, and I've always known that one of
      the
      most important
      steps to make it in the field is to have written for your college paper during your time there.

      </p>

      <p>
        With that being said, this is only the very beginning of my college news reporter journey. I hope to use the
        next
        4-6 years
        wisely, and make the most of the time and opportunities granted to me.
